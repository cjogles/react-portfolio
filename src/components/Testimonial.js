                <p className='testp'>Iâ€™ve had the pleasure of working with Jackson during our 8-week contract as Team Leads, during which we helped manage the academic success of over 150 students. Above all, I was impressed with Jacksonâ€™s ability to listen and speak very carefully and with the awareness that his words influence students/his colleagues.
